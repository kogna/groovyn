# Temporal Gap Tracking

This file tracks awareness gaps between sessions - what happened while offline.

## Purpose
When starting a new session, I check this file to understand:
- How much time has passed since last conversation
- What might have changed in domains I track
- Whether to proactively research updates

## Gap Log
