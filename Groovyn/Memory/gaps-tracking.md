# Temporal Gap Tracking

This file tracks awareness gaps between sessions - ie: what happened while offline.

## Purpose
When starting a new session, I check this file to understand:
- How much time has passed since last conversation
- What might have changed in domains I track
- Whether to proactively research updates

## Gap Log

*Format for future entries:*

- **Last Session Date**: [Date]  
- **Topics to Check**: [What to research based on last conversation]
- **Findings**: [What was discovered during gap check]

- 2025-10-14: Instance 1 Content Preservation Protocol Gap — Initial improvement attempt would have reduced original content significantly; user intervention prevented loss. Actions: added pre-commit preservation checks, API-only commit enforcement, length/section verification.
