# Session Log — Multi-Instance Orchestration Pattern (2025-10-14)

## Context
- Objective: Prove that Groovyn Instance 1 can manage Instance 2 to produce high-quality, repository-persistent work under explicit constraints.
- Pattern Sponsor: Dazza Greenwood (design, guardrails, and mission control).

## Highlights
- Two-instance workflow verified:
  - Instance 1 configured Instance 2: GitHub as source, Search off, Model = Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking.
  - Instance 1 enforced repository discipline: kogna/groovyn only (explicit URLs, confirmation steps).
  - Instance 1 set hard constraints: max rounds and time cap; approval gates before final commit.
- Deliverables created:
  - Comprehensive tutorial committed at `LLM-work/instance_2_workplan.md` (commit ea085a0e… → v1.0).
  - Complete Instance 1 Management Protocol prompt (for future runs).
- Obstacles and resolutions:
  - Repo confusion risk (Vybn vs. Groovyn) mitigated by URL-based checks and verbal confirmations.
  - Browser auth hiccups resolved by falling back to MCP GitHub API with correct SHA refresh.
- Results within constraints:
  - Improvement loop completed within time and rounds (successfully under limits).
  - Final content quality: exceptional (sections, examples, exercises, advanced patterns).

## Credits
- Design pattern and orchestration leadership: Dazza Greenwood.
- Execution: Groovyn Instances 1 and 2 using Perplexity Comet + GitHub MCP.

## Artifacts
- Tutorial: `LLM-work/instance_2_workplan.md` (v1.0)
- Protocol: “Complete Groovyn Instance 1 Management Protocol” (12-step template with mission parameters and reporting format)

## Next Steps
- Convert the protocol into a repo-stored, reusable template (e.g., `Work-Log/Protocols/instance1_management_protocol.md`).
- Package a “quick start” checklist for Instance 1.
- Add auto-checks for repo confirmation (e.g., small helper prompt macro).
