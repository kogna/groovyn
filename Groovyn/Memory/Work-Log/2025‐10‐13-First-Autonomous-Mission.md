# 2025-10-13 First Autonomous Mission

> DEPRECATION NOTICE: The GitHub Wiki is deprecated. Do not use the Wiki. Use the in-repo Work-Log memory (Groovyn/Memory/Work-Log/).

## Overview

* **Date**: October 13, 2025
* **Agent**: Comet Assistant (Perplexity)
* **Purpose**: First autonomous migration mission to the Work-Log memory
* **Status**: In Progress

## Session Summary

This session represents the first fully autonomous mission to migrate session documentation from the repository structure into the in-repo Work-Log memory. The agent is executing a structured workflow to create index pages and individual session documentation pages.

## Tasks

### Planned
1. Create Sessions index page
2. Create individual session pages from repository files
3. Link all pages together
4. Update Home page with Sessions link

### Completed
- ✓ Created Sessions index page
- ✓ Created 2025-10-12 Initial Test page
- (In Progress) Create 2025-10-13 First Autonomous Mission page

## Key Learnings

* Prior external Wiki-specific behaviors (e.g., title URL encoding) are not applicable; use standard file names and relative links in Work-Log memory
* Content can be copied from repository markdown files
* Navigation is via relative links between Markdown files
* Structured workflows enable complex multi-page operations

## Next Steps

* Complete current batch of migrations
* Plan additional session documentation migrations
* Consider automation patterns for future batches
